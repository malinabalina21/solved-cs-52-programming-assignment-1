<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project 1:</strong> <strong>Winter Break!</strong>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Write a C++ program that displays something you did or happened to you over the Winter break on screen in large letters.  There should be no input, only output.  For example, I went to painted my bathroom walls, so my output would look like:

<p style="font-weight: 400;">PPPP    A   IIIII N   N TTTTT EEEEE DDDD   !P   P  A A    I   NN  N   T   E     D   D  !PPPP  AAAAA   I   N N N   T   EEE   D   D  !P     A   A   I   N  NN   T   E     D   DP     A   A IIIII N   N   T   EEEEE DDDD  !!!

Generate this output by using cout statements.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Write a C++ program that accepts a single numeric value which will serve as the length of the side of an equilateral triangle or the length of a square.  Compute the perimeter of each one by using the formula:     perimeter = 3 * side     for the triangle and      perimeter = 4 * side   for the square .  The program dialog should look like this:

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enter a side length (in inches): <strong><em>5</em><em>0.0</em></strong>The Perimeter Of A Square With 1 Side Of This Length = 200.0 inchesThe Perimeter Of An Equilateral Triangle With 1 Side Of This Length = 150.0 inches
